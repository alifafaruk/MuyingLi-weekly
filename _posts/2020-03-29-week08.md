title: Week 8 -- A Real Start on Our Final Project, p5.js-website
---

After a nice quaratined spring break, everything seems back on track; after several group meetings, we prepare ourselves well to contribute to our final project -- [p5.js-website](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website). This open-source project is mainly for [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) website maintenance (obviously from the name of the repository). I had experience with [processing 3](https://processing.org/) in Java, and p5.js is a JavaScript version of processing, a language turning code into a sketchbook for visual arts. <br><br>

The are many reasons that make us finally pick p5.js as our project. One is that it p5.js is pretty new; basically they need a lot of help for the new website, in aspectes to __porting examples from processing, adding inline documentation for examples, translating into Chinese__ (they call it [i18n](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/master/contributor_docs/i18n_contribution.md)) and more. Also, p5.js appeals to us in that all of us want to contribute to a persistent project related to JavaScript. Meanwhile, the community is very welcoming, friendly and super responsive（from what we observed and experienced）. <br><br>

In our latest meeting, we digged deeper in what we can contribute to:
* Correct typos and invalid links -- I and Matthew already contributed a little in this part
* [Add inline documentations](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/2865) as the project needs
* Transporting old Java examples from processing 3 into JavaScript to p5.js -- currently, we encountered a difficulty in that the examples in processing 3 might not be portable into JavaScript
* [Adding our own creative examples](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/master/contributor_docs/Adding_examples.md)
* [Translating examples into Chinese](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/issues/632#issuecomment-605448784) -- I and Sijia are going to work on this in next few weeks

In a word, there are tons of things we can contribute to.<br><br>

This weekend, I found two typos on their website, which are no longer existing because I raised it as [my FIRST issue](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/issues/632), and they assigned it to me, so I made a PR (https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/637), and finally two files' changes were successfully MERGED yesterday! It is so encouraging for me -- a newbee to open-source project community, and I immediately witnessed the changes I made on their current website XD. Such excitement is no less than when I received a graduate school offer lol. In next two months, I'm going to turn the community's "thanks" into motivations and keep contributing. I believe I will enjoy the sense of accomplishment a lot, even if only there is only a tiny bit of accomplishment I made.<br><br>

In this week's remote classes, we continued the topic of rebasing. Through the hands-on exercises, I finally understand not only the idea of rebasing, but how to look a git log (from bottom to top). Also, right now, I'm very comfortable with git commands such as branching, forking and more, which will help me a lot when I keep contributing to p5.js. The classes prepared me to my further contribution to the open-source project.
